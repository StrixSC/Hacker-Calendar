# Hacker Calendar
Hacker Calendar is an auto-updating Google Calendar containing dates to notable hacker events and competitions.

Hacker Calendar provides a Google Calendar mostly powered by [clist.by](https://clist.by), a phenomenal ressource providing good and structured information to help programmers and hackers with coordinating competitions and events.

The bonus of implementing a wrapper around the platform, is the ability to provide even more dates to other events, such as HackTheBox/TryHackMe machines end-of-life, CTFs that are not listed on CTFTime, hackathons or events/competitions.

The purpose of the project is to provide a way to export the information provided by CList into a platform that is more versatile, such as Google Calendar.
